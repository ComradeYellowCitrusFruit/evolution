# A Simple Evolution Simulator

A simple evolution simulator written in Rust.
The simulator uses neural networks of traits to control the behavior of simple cells.
These cells are then selected to produce offspring based of some critera, and any cells who do not meet the critera do not.
Occasionally, mutations to a cells genes occur.
